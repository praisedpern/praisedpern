### Hi, and thanks for visiting my profile. ðŸ‘‹

### Iâ€™m a lifelong computer enthusiast, and long-time Linux dabbler. I created my profile both so I can learn git, and keep track of the projects I'm working on with my friends.

### - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning git and node.js, and brushing up on shell scripting.
