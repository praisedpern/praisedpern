<!-- Version 1 :

Hi, and thanks for visiting my profile. ðŸ‘‹

My [personal repo](https://github.com/praisedpern/praisedpern/) is where I
throw my dotfiles so I can quickly set them up on new machines/installs. Feel
free to take a look/clone/fork them.

### init.vim
- It's made for use with nvim
- Please note my init.vim uses 'set exrc' which is 
[considered insecure](https://www.google.com/search?q=set+exrc) and is deprecated in nvim

I'm on a bit of an vim discovery journey and I took inspiration from videos
by
[Luke Smith](https://odysee.com/@Luke:7), 
[Mental Outlaw](https://odysee.com/@AlphaNerd:8) and 
[ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ENHE5xdFSwx71u3fDH5Xw)
to customise this setup.

Following is default:

**praisedpern/praisedpern** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its
`README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
